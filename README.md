# Recipe search app

This simple demo is used to search and view recipes served from an external API. The API I used is the free version of [Edamam.com](https://developer.edamam.com/) Recipe Search API. The free version has some limitations, one of which is the request limit of 5 per minute. Therefore, sometimes the application can cause problems, then just wait a while.

## Technologies used:
-React\
-Bootstrap 4
